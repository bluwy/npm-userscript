| Feature              | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `better-versions`    | Improved package versions tab with compact table view, show tags next to versions, and fix provenance icon alignment.                                                                    |
| `fix-issue-pr-count` | Show "Issue" and "Pull Requests" counts in the package sidebar. At the time of writing, npm's own implementation is broken for large numbers for some reason. This temporarily fixes it. |
| `fix-styles`         | Fix various style issues on the npm site (mostly the package page at the moment).                                                                                                        |
| `move-funding`       | Move the "Fund this package" button to the bottom of the sidebar.                                                                                                                        |
| `no-code-beta`       | Hide the "Beta" label in the package code tab because it has been working for around 3 years now.                                                                                        |
| `npm-create`         | If the package is named `create-*`, change the suggested install command in the sidebar as `npm create *` instead of `npm install create-*`.                                             |
| `remember-banner`    | Remember the banner at the top of the page when dismissed, so it doesn't keep showing up.                                                                                                |
| `remove-runkit`      | Remove the RunKit link as it's dead.                                                                                                                                                     |
